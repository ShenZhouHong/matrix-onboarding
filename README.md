# Onboarding Document and Tutorial for Matrix
A simple onboarding document for non-technical users, on what Matrix is, it's benefits, and how to get on board.

The canonical version of the onboarding document is written in Markdown, with various media assets (pictures, etc) located in the `./media` folder.

The `federation.png` network diagram is made using draw.io, and the source xml file (which can be edited) is saved to `./media` as `./federation.xml`.

To compile, just

    $ make
    
it!
